```

## Data Storage

The application uses JSON file storage in the `data/` directory. All data is automatically persisted to `distribution_data.json`. The file is created automatically on first run.

### Data Structure

```json
{
  "products": [],
  "inventory": [],
  "customers": [],
  "deliveries": []
}
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Dashboard
- `GET /products` - Product management page
- `POST /api/products` - Add new product
- `GET /inventory` - Inventory management page
- `POST /api/inventory` - Add inventory
- `GET /customers` - Customer management page
- `POST /api/customers` - Add new customer
- `GET /deliveries` - Delivery management page
- `POST /api/deliveries` - Schedule delivery
- `POST /api/deliveries/<id>/status` - Update delivery status
- `GET /api/stats` - Get statistics (JSON)

## Configuration

### Development Mode

The application runs on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` by default. Debug mode is controlled via the `FLASK_DEBUG` environment variable for security:

```bash
# Enable debug mode for development (automatic reload, detailed errors)
export FLASK_DEBUG=true  # Linux/Mac
set FLASK_DEBUG=true     # Windows

# Disable debug mode for production (recommended)
export FLASK_DEBUG=false # Linux/Mac
set FLASK_DEBUG=false    # Windows
```

The start scripts (`start.sh` and `start.bat`) automatically enable debug mode for development convenience.

### Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Disable debug mode**: Set `FLASK_DEBUG=false` or unset the variable
2. **Use a production WSGI server** like Gunicorn or uWSGI:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
   ```
3. **Use a reverse proxy** (Nginx or Apache) with HTTPS
4. **Change the SECRET_KEY** to a strong random value
5. **Consider using a proper database** instead of JSON files for better performance and reliability

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- Database integration (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- User authentication and authorization
- Reporting and analytics
- Export data to CSV/Excel
- Email notifications for deliveries
- Mobile application
- Multi-location support
